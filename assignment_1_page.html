		<h3> The Internet </h3>
		<h4> When getting access to websites along with Youtube, you would use the net.

A server is where websites are stored, and it works plenty like your pc's tough drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the internet site and sends the correct information lower back to your computer. Unlike the World Wide Web, the net is a large community of networks related through billions of computer systems. The World Wide Web is a manner of getting access to these facts over the medium of the internet. Without the internet, it's miles still possible to get right of entry to net browsers such as google chrome, however you wouldn't be able to seek up whatever or view any data on any websites.

	<p> <h3> Internet Protocol </h3>
		<h4> The Internet Protocol additionally called IP is a fixed of regulations which routes addressing packets of statistics so that it will travel throughout networks and arrive at the same destination. When in the internet, it is divided into smaller pieces. These are referred to as packets and are the motive why you have net. An IP is used to allows routers ship those packets to the proper place. Everything that connects to the internet may have an IP address. All packets might be directed to these IP deal with on where net and facts is needed. When looking up a website domain, you will almost continually see HTTP on the start. In fact, HTTP is the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is an underlying protocol used by the WORLD WIDE WEB that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also tells Web servers and browsers what must do throught numerous commands. When you input an HTTP command to the web browser which include Chrome, it sends an HTTP command to the web server directing it to fetch and transmit the asked Web page. An IP or internet protocol does now not deal with packet ordering or mistakes checking. Instead, we use TCP or Transmission Control Panel which does that. TCP collects all of the info given by way of the information connected with IP and it kinds its out into the proper order. It additionally tells if there are missing portions and tells that it's been received. Hence the relationship among them. FTP or File Transfer Protocol is a commone protocol used for exchanging documents over the internet. FTP uses TCP/IP as cited before to enable data transfer. It lets in sharing of documents through far off computers. To transfer documents to and from every other.</h4>
