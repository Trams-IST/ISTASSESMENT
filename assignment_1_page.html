		<h3> World Wide Web </h3>
		<h4> The World Wide Web including this website, is used by millions of people everyday. They use it from ordering food or chatting with friends, to raising funds or even browse Youtube. It is all around us and is automatically installed in apps such as Safari or Chrome. </h4> </p>
			<p><b> <h4> What is it then? </b> 
			 Each website such as this one is connected to a web server. Each server has been coded or designed to store information and share it. Each website is filled with information and linking that information together in an organized way. This is then used for others to access.</h4></p>
		
		<p> <h4> These websites have a web server that is coded in with a bunch of web languages such as HTML or Javasvript. Examples of things these web servers have are images, texts, videos, and application data. A web server can host and have multiple website using the same software and hardware sources; In this case, Sublime Text. </h4>
		</p>
		<p> <h4> Examples include: </h4> </p>

		<h3> The Internet </h3>
		<h4> When accessing websites such as Youtube, you would use the internet. Once you are connected to the internet, it allows you to access and view websites from web browsers such as Chrome. The internet is such an important thing in our lives. It allows you to connect to other people and access any information from countries that are connected to the internet. </h4>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4> The internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. The Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer. </h4> </p>
	<p>	<h4> Unlike the World Wide Web, the internet is a massive network of networks connected by billions of computers. The World Wide Web is a way of accessing these information over the medium of the internet. Without the internet, it is still possible to access web browsers such as google chrome, but you wouldn't be able to search up anything or view any data on any websites. It instead sends you to a no internet page where you can play the famous Dinosaur Game. </h4> </p>

	<p>
		<h3> Intranet </h3>
		<h4> The intranet is a lot like the internet. The internet is a global network network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. Without the internet, you wouldn't be able to access or view any information. Just like the Internet, the intranet is a network of computers and other electronic devices. It is used by private businesses, schools or company. It can be website and is inaccessible to the public through the World Wide Web. The internet is publically accessible while the intranet isn't. The intranet alows you to engage with your company/school and collaborate with your colleagues, anytime, anywhere. Depending on your company security, this means 24/7 access to your organization’s digital environment — at your desk, your house or even on the beach.</h4>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>Anyone that would want to access this network would need to have a special network password and be connected to LAN(Local Area Network). A firewall software is essential to protect private documents from the users. Firewall stands between the outside internet and the private intranet. </h4>
	</p>
	<p> <h3> Internet Protocol </h3>
		<h4> The Internet Protocol also known as IP is a set of  rules which routes addressing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the same destination. When in the internet,  it is divided into smaller pieces. These are called packets and are the reason why you have internet. An IP is used to helps routers send these packets to the right place. Everything that connects to the internet will have an IP address. All packets would be directed to these IP address on where internet and data is needed. </h4>
	</p>
	<p> <h4> When searching up a website domain, you would almost always see HTTP at the start. In fact, HTTP is the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is an underlying protocol used by the WORLD WIDE WEB that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also tells Web servers and browsers what should do throught various commands. When you enter an HTTP command to the web browser such as Chrome, it sends an HTTP command to the web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page. </h4></p>

	<p><h4> An IP or internet protocol does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Instead, we use TCP or Transmission Control Panel which does that. TCP collects all the info given by the data connected with IP and it sorts its out into the right order. It also tells if there are missing pieces and tells that it has been received. Hence the relationship between them. </h4></p>
	<p> <h4> FTP or File Transfer Protocol is a commone protocol used for exchanging files over the internet. FTP uses TCP/IP as mentioned before to enable data transfer. It allows sharing of files via remote computers. To transfer files to and from each other  </h4></p>
